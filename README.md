# SpotifyProject
The purpose of this project is to pull data related to my songs from the Spotify API.

## pull_data.ipynb
A jupyter notebook that walks through how to pull data from the Spotify API, with some data cleaning

## my_saved_tracks.csv
Information and audio features for every song saved from my spotify library

## tokens.py
This is excluded from the github repo, so you'll need to recreate it and include your own authtokens and username there
